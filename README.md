# "ChatApp"

This project was a simple testing for php functionalities combining it with MySql database. 

Chat is not really done professionally but rather simple simulation was done via ajax. Other functionality include combining HTML, JS, CSS, PHP and MySql - read/write/change data from the database via interface.
